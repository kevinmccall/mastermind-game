# Mastermind Game

Mastermind game implemented in Java for my honors contract in CS 151.

Run `java Game` then use STDIN to input guesses(Can be either colors or numbers 0-5).

## How to Enable AI

Set `boolean isAIPlaying = true;` in mvp/Game.java

## Learning outcomes

During the process of making this game, I learned about the following:

-   Minimax technique - how to minimize the amount of things you don't want to happen
-   Effeciency - I learned of the differences of worst case scenarios for data structures like priority queues and hashmaps
-   Version Control - I learned about multiple powerful features in git like `git diff`
